# Who's That Pokemon (Currently Under Construction)

A tensorflow project designed to predict pokemon types

webScraping.js - a webscraper that collects images of different pokemon and save them locally
resizeImages.js - resizes all those images to a uniform 50px by 50px
getPixelData.js - converts local images into pixel data necessary to train a ML model
